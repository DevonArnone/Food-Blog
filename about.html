                    <p>Thomas Spiese: I made this website because lots of single men don't know how to cook or where to start. This website offers a place, just for men, to learn how to cook to help them with their fitness, wallet, and health.</p>

                    <p>Joshua Garay: I created this website because I was searching for a resource like this myself. I wanted a straightforward, fun way to learn cooking techniques, plan meals, and discover recipes that suit my lifestyle. When I couldn't find exactly what I needed, I decided to build it instead—for myself and anyone else in the same boat!</p>
